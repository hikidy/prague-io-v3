Pretty much everything in definitions.js has been migrated to `server/modules/definitions`.

group guide (by taureon):
bosses   : anything related to bosses
dev      : developer tanks, beta tester tanks, admin/mod tanks
food     : anything polygon related
generics : genericTank, genericEntity, food, bullet, drone, trap
misc     : anything else, like arena closers, walls, bots, buttons, rocks, etc.
tanks    : normally playable tanks you can achieve just by being a high enough level
these groups also include turrets/projectiles that only they use
